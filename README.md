# StyleScout
Using neural networks to detect clothes of a style you like

# Done so far
* Download items from the eBay API, turning their most important properties into tags into tags
* Store pickled DB of downloaded items

# Rough roadmap
* add labels correctly
* find an alternative to pickle to storing data
* find out how to use inception with other sizes than 299
* Find an efficient way to like items
* Train NN against extracted tags
* Add other eBay sites/countries, internationalize
* Add other services (e.g. Zalando, Kleiderkreisel, ...)
* World domination!
